# WHAT IS THIS JUNK? #
Script will scrape list of member from the the100.io for group ID you specify<br>
Next it will call the Bungie API and get the time played for each member<br>

# WHAT STATE IS IT IN? #
Time played reflects both battle and social space. Working on battle time only.

Very little error handling<br>
