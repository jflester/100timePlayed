# WHAT IS THIS JUNK? #
Script will scrape list of member from the the100.io for group ID you specify<br>
Next it will call the Bungie API and get the time played for each member<br>

# WHAT STATE IS IT IN? #
Beta<br>
No error handling yet<br>
Works for me where expected<br>
Last bit of core work is to automate number of pages to scrape for users<br>
Its hard coded at '9' for now<br>
Find your group number in the URL when viewing your groups the100 page<br>
https://www.the100.io/groups/1412<br>

# HOW DO I USE IT #
Launch it with the required command line arguments of group ID:<br>
./timePlayed.sh [groupID]<br>
./timePlayed.sh 1412<br>

# REQUIRED FILES

# ABOUT apiKey.sh #

Thats all<br>
